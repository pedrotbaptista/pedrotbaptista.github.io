I am a Research Trainee at the European Central Bank working with . Prior to that, I was a trader in the Emerging Markets fixed-income desk at Banco de Portugal.
I hold a Bsc in Economics from Universidade Católica Portuguesa and an MPhil in Economics from the University of Cambridge.<br /> 

I am interested in studying the behavior of small entities and their dynamics within large complex systems.
My research interests lie in financial markets, debt sustainability, labour economics, social networks and human capital theory. <br />

I write at [escassez de ideias](https://www.escassezdeideias.substack.com/) (in Portuguese). <br />

You can contact me at pedro dot baptista at ecb dot europa dot eu.
