I am a Trainee at the Economics Directorate of the European Central Bank working with the Consumer Expectations Survey. Prior to that, I was a Research Assistant at the Bank of Portugal.
I hold a BSc in Economics from Universidade Católica Portuguesa and an MPhil in Economics from the University of Cambridge.<br /> 

I am interested in studying the dynamics of welfare systems and the effect of taxation on economic behaviour.

My research interests lie in public and household finance, labour economics, and applied econometrics. <br />

From time to time, I write at [escassez de ideias](https://escassezdeideias.substack.com/) (in Portuguese). <br />
